# Overview
Soundsboard is a fun and interactive soundboard application featuring popular meme audios from both Argentina and around the world. It's designed to enhance your live streams on platforms like Twitch, Kick, TikTok Live, or YouTube by adding dynamic and engaging sound effects. You can trigger sounds by clicking on the corresponding letter or pressing the key, and stop the currently playing sound with the spacebar.

## Features
- **Wide Range of Meme Sounds**: Enjoy a diverse collection of meme audios to spice up your streams.
- **Interactive Controls**: Play sounds with a click or a key press, and stop them with the spacebar.
- **Stream Enhancement**: Add a layer of fun and interactivity to your live videos.

## How It Works
Simply click on a letter or press the corresponding key to play a sound. Press the spacebar to stop any currently playing sound, making it easy to manage your audio effects during a live stream.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.

## Getting Started
To get started with Soundsboard, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soundsboard.git
cd soundsboard
npm install
npm start
```

## Note on freeCodeCamp Tests
If you run the freeCodeCamp tests, one test might fail because it expects only 9 letters for sound triggers. However, I decided to include more letters to make the application more complete.
